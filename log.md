100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a utilities class to help request data from the guardian api and parse it for use in my news app. I also added the Article Loader class and the implementation of the LoaderManager callback methods.  

**Thoughts:** I thought I had created each of my project files carefully, but I am getting an error that is not very easy to understand. My current error occurs when I try to build the app and says something about "ArticleLoader is not abstract and does not override abstract method loadInBackground() in AsyncTaskLoader". I will need to fix this tomorrow.

### Day 2: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new Android app to view a news list. Today I setup the layout files and the Article class. 

**Thoughts:** I was happy to find that creating the layour and class for the Article objects came naturally after having done this for other apps. Looking forward to feeling comfortable about other concepts.

### Day 0: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored android app to use an AsyncTaskLoader instead of an embedded AsyncTask 

**Thoughts:** This is related to the android course in Udacity and even though I am not 100% about the AsyncTask, I do see that using the AsyncTaskLoader is a great way to run multiple processes for an app.
