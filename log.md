# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Refactored android app to use an AsyncTaskLoader instead of an embedded AsyncTask 

**Thoughts:** This is related to the android course in Udacity and even though I am not 100% about the AsyncTask, I do see that using the AsyncTaskLoader is a great way to run multiple processes for an app.
