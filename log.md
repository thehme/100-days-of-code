### Day 2: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new Android app to view a news list. Today I setup the layout files and the Article class. 

**Thoughts:** I was happy to find that creating the layour and class for the Article objects came naturally after having done this for other apps. Looking forward to feeling comfortable about other concepts.

### Day 0: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored android app to use an AsyncTaskLoader instead of an embedded AsyncTask 

**Thoughts:** This is related to the android course in Udacity and even though I am not 100% about the AsyncTask, I do see that using the AsyncTaskLoader is a great way to run multiple processes for an app.
